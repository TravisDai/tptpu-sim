# tptpu-sim
A Toy-Purpose TPU Simulator

TPU (tensor-processing unit) is Google's deep learning architecture for inference (all versions) and training (all versions except 1) focusing mainly on its systolic array-based computation method and throughput.

Here's a link to Google's first paper on TPU, from arXiv and later published in 2017 ISCA.

TPTPU-Sim is a cycle-level simulator built to simulate with different bandwidth/frequency configurations than the original TPU to see what changes, and gain more insight into how architecture for deep learning should focus on.
